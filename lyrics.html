        God, bless us everyone
        We're a broken people living under loaded gun
        And it can't be outfought
        It can't be outdone
        It can't be outmatched
        It can't be outrun, no!

        God, bless us everyone
        We're a broken people living under loaded gun
        And it can't be outfought
        It can't be outdone
        It can't be outmatched
        It can't be outrun, no!

        And when I close my eyes tonight
        To symphonies of blinding light
        God, bless us everyone
        We're a broken people living under loaded gun

        Oh, like memories in cold decay
        Transmissions echoing away
        Far from the world of you and I
        Where oceans bleed into the sky

        God, save us everyone
        Will we burn inside the fires of a thousand suns?
        For the sins of our hand
        The sins of our tongue
        The sins of our fathers
        The sins of our young, no!

        God, save us everyone
        Will we burn inside the fires of a thousand suns?
        For the sins of our hand
        The sins of our tongue
        The sins of our fathers
        The sins of our young, no!

        And when I close my eyes tonight
        To symphonies of blinding light!
        God, save us everyone
        Will we burn inside the fires of a thousand suns?

        Oh, like memories in cold decay
        Transmissions echoing away
        Far from the world of you and I
        Where oceans bleed into the sky

        Oh, like memories in cold decay
        Transmissions echoing away
        Far from the world of you and I
        Where oceans bleed into the sky

        Lift me up, let me go
        Lift me up, let me go
        Lift me up, let me go
        Lift me up, let me go
        Lift me up, let me go
        Lift me up, let me go
        Lift me up, let me go
        Lift me up, let me go
        Lift me up, let me go-

        And it can't be outfought
        It can't be outdone
        It can't be outmatched
        It can't be outrun, no!
        God, bless us everyone
        We're a broken people living under loaded gun
        
        And it can't be outfought
        It can't be outdone
        It can't be outmatched
        It can't be outrun, no!
        God, bless us everyone
        We're a broken people living under loaded gun
        And it can't be outfought
        It can't be outdone
        It can't be outmatched
        It can't be outrun
